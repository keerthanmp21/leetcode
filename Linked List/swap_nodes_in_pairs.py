The `swapPairs` function swaps adjacent nodes in a linked list. Hereâ€™s the analysis of 
its time and space complexity:

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is (O(n)), where (n) is the number of nodes in the linked list. 
The function iterates through the list, processing pairs of nodes. Each node is visited
 once, making the time complexity linear.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is (O(1)). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space 
for the pointers (`dummy`, `cur`, `res`) and does not create any additional data 
structures proportional to the input size.

### Summary
- **Time Complexity:** (O(n))
- **Space Complexity:** (O(1))
