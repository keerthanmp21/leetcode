'''
The time and space complexity of the `openLock` function can be analyzed as follows:

### Time Complexity:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The function uses a BFS approach to explore all
 possible combinations of the lock. Each lock state can be represented as a 4-digit 
 string, resulting in \(10^4 = 10,000\) possible states (from "0000" to "9999").
2. **Children Generation**: For each lock state, the function generates up to 8 
children (2 for each of the 4 positions).
3. **Overall Complexity**: In the worst case, we may need to visit all \(10,000\) 
states, and for each state, we generate 8 children. Thus, the time complexity is:
   O(10^4â‹…8)=O(10^4)

### Space Complexity:
1. **Queue**: The BFS queue can store all possible states. In the worst case, it could store up to \(10,000\) states.
2. **Visited Set**: The `visited` set also needs to store all possible states, leading to another \(O(10^4)\) space usage.
3. **Overall Complexity**: Therefore, the space complexity is:
   [O(10^4)]

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(10^4)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(10^4)\)
