The `shortestBridge` function is designed to find the shortest path to connect two 
islands in a binary grid. Letâ€™s analyze its time and space complexity:

### Time Complexity:
1. **DFS for Island Identification**:
   - The DFS function explores all cells of one island. In the worst case, this could 
   visit all \(N^2\) cells of the grid, where \(N\) is the number of rows or columns.
   - Thus, the time complexity for the DFS step is \(O(N^2)\).

2. **BFS for Shortest Path**:
   - After identifying one island, the BFS is initiated. The BFS could also potentially 
   visit all cells in the grid, and for each cell, it checks its 4 neighbors.
   - Therefore, the time complexity for the BFS step is also \(O(N^2)\).

3. **Overall Time Complexity**:
   - Since both the DFS and BFS could run independently through all \(N^2\) cells, 
   the overall time complexity is:
   \[
   O(N^2)
   \]

### Space Complexity:
1. **Visited Set**: 
   - The `visit` set stores cells of one island and possibly additional cells during 
   the BFS. In the worst case, it could contain up to \(N^2\) cells.
   - Therefore, the space complexity due to the visited set is \(O(N^2)\).

2. **Queue for BFS**:
   - The BFS uses a queue that can also hold up to \(O(N^2)\) cells at once in the 
   worst case.
   
3. **Overall Space Complexity**:
   - Thus, the overall space complexity is:
   \[
   O(N^2)
   \]

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\)
