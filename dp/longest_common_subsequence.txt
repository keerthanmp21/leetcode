The given class `Solution` implements three different approaches to solving the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** problem.

## **Method 1: NaÃ¯ve Recursion (`longestCommonSubsequence1`)**
### **Explanation:**
- The function uses a recursive approach to compare characters in `text1` and `text2` from index `(i, j)`.
- If characters match, it recursively calls `backtrack(i + 1, j + 1)`, adding `1` to the result.
- If characters do not match, it takes the maximum of two recursive calls: `backtrack(i + 1, j)` and `backtrack(i, j + 1)`.
- This method explores all possible subsequences, leading to redundant calculations.

### **Time Complexity:**
- Since each call makes at most **two recursive calls**, the recursion tree grows exponentially.
- The worst-case time complexity is **O(2^(M+N))**, where `M` and `N` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2`.
- This happens because in the worst case (completely different strings), the function generates all possible subsequences.

### **Space Complexity:**
- The recursion depth can go up to **O(M + N)** in the worst case.
- Since there is no explicit memory storage, the space complexity is **O(M + N)** due to recursive stack calls.

## **Method 2: Memoized Recursion (`longestCommonSubsequence2`)**
### **Explanation:**
- This approach improves upon the naÃ¯ve recursion by **storing previously computed results** in a dictionary (`dp`).
- Before making a recursive call, it checks if the result is already in `dp`.
- If yes, it returns the stored value instead of recomputing.

### **Time Complexity:**
- The recursion explores `(i, j)` pairs at most **once**, and there are `M Ã— N` possible pairs.
- This reduces the time complexity to **O(M Ã— N)**, which is significantly better than the exponential approach.

### **Space Complexity:**
- The memoization table (`dp`) stores results for **O(M Ã— N)** subproblems.
- The recursion stack still takes up **O(M + N)** space.
- Thus, the overall space complexity is **O(M Ã— N) + O(M + N) = O(M Ã— N)**.

---

## **Method 3: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming (`longestCommonSubsequence`)**
### **Explanation:**
- Instead of using recursion, this method constructs a **DP table (`dp`)** iteratively.
- `dp[i][j]` represents the LCS of `text1[i:]` and `text2[j:]`.
- If `text1[i] == text2[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i+1][j+1]` (matching characters add 1 to the LCS).
- Otherwise, take the max of ignoring either `text1[i]` or `text2[j]`:  
  `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])`.

### **Time Complexity:**
- We fill up an `M Ã— N` table iteratively.
- The time complexity is **O(M Ã— N)**.

### **Space Complexity:**
- The `dp` table has `M Ã— N` entries, requiring **O(M Ã— N)** space.
- However, since each `dp[i][j]` only depends on the next row, we can optimize space to **O(N)** using a **rolling array technique**.

## **Comparison of the Three Approaches**
| Method | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Approach Type |
|--------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **NaÃ¯ve Recursion** | O(2^(M+N)) | O(M + N) | Exponential (Slow) |
| **Memoized Recursion** | O(M Ã— N) | O(M Ã— N) | Optimized Recursion |
| **Bottom-Up DP** | O(M Ã— N) | O(M Ã— N) (or O(N) with optimization) | Iterative DP (Efficient) |

### **Best Choice:**
- **Bottom-up DP** is the most efficient in terms of execution.
- If space is a concern, **rolling array optimization** can reduce it to **O(N)**.
- **Memoization** is useful when recursion-based solutions are easier to understand.
